# Sellcentric

Sellcentric is an enterprise-scale e-commerce platform written in PHP using the [*Symfony Framework*](http://symfony-project.org/) framework.

[I](http://robbymillsap.com) created Sellcentric because I was forced to work on back-to-back-to-back-to-back [Magento](http://magentocommerce.com) projects and it absolutely drove me nuts.  

Here are the guiding principals of Sellcentric

* Sellcentric is lightweight and fast
* Sellcentric is based on a simple MVC architecture pattern
* Sellcentric is highly customizable

## Other notes
For maximum productivity I recommend using [NetBeans w/Symfony](http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/symfony-screencast.html).  But it is not required.  If you would like to contribute to this project please contact me at
