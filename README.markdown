# Sellcentric

Sellcentric is an enterprise-scale e-commerce platform written in PHP using the [*Symfony*](http://symfony-project.org/) framework.

I,[Sap](http://robbymillsap.com), created Sellcentric because I was forced to work on back-to-back-to-back-to-back [Magento](http://magentocommerce.com) projects and it absolutely drove me nuts. Magento has some great features in it (administration is excellent) but it is a beast to work with when all you want is a speedy e-commerce platform. 

Here are the guiding principals of Sellcentric

* Sellcentric is lightweight and fast
* Sellcentric is based on a simple MVC architecture pattern
* Sellcentric is highly customizable

## Other notes
For maximum productivity I recommend using [NetBeans w/Symfony](http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/symfony-screencast.html).  But it is not required.  If you would like to contribute to this project please contact me at

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/rmillsap/sellcentric/wiki) for installation instructions and the development roadmap.

Peace, love, and the consumption of many delicious burritos...
